# MyToDoList

A to-do list is a effective tool for organizing tasks and managing time. 
It typically consists of a list of tasks or activities that need to be completed, along with checkboxes or other indicators to mark them as done when finished. 
To-do lists can range from handwritten notes on paper to digital applications and can be used for personal, professional, or academic purposes. 
They help individuals prioritize tasks, stay focused, and track progress towards their goals.
